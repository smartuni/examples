Below you also find\r\na brief description to build the examples.\r\n\r\n### src/button\r\n\r\nThis tool shows some basic interaction with the Atmel SAM R21 board, namely\r\ncontrol the onboard LED0 by pressing a button (SW0). Corresponding output\r\nis also available via terminal connection.\r\n\r\n### src/pingpong\r\n\r\nThis program demonstrates a simple network protocol. Node A sends a PING message\r\nto the multicast group address ```[ff02::1]```, if a node B receives the PING it\r\nresponse with a PONG message send to the link local unicast address of node A.\r\nPING message can be initiated via terminal connection to access the shell. PONG\r\nmessages are send automatically when a PING was received.\r\n\r\n### build and run\r\n\r\nDownload or clone this example repository to your development system. To build\r\nthe small tools you also need to download the\r\n[RIOT](https://github.com/riot-os/riot) source code.\r\n\r\nSet the following environmental variables according to you system:\r\n```\r\nexport BOARD=samr21-xpro\r\nexport PORT=/dev/tty.usb[XYZabc]\r\nexport RIOTBASE=<path/to/riot/repo>\r\nexport PATH=<path/to/gcc-arm-none-eabi>/bin:$PATH\r\n```\r\nAfterwards you should be able to compile the program, flash it onto the board\r\nand connect a terminal via the usb-serial adapter:\r\n```\r\ncd src/[button|pingpong]\r\nmake && make flash && make term\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
